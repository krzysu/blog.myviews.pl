Why Rocket Internet companies are doomed to failure


A few days ago I met by chance an old work colleague. Besides some small-talks, one part particularly caught my attention. It was something like:
- “I’m looking for a new job” 
- “Why?”
- “My company hired a new manager from one of Rocket companies, and it’s really terrible now”
- “Oh, sad to hear that, why is so terrible?”
- “He introduced Rocket style of work so our culture dropped and people started to look for another jobs. I don’t want to work like that”
This story only adds up to many others I’ve heard before in Berlin. I also worked for 2 years in one of Rocket Internet’s companies, so I have first hand experience myself.
I know that you don’t have much time to read some unknown guy (me) complaining, so without further intro let’s get to the point. Why rocket venture companies are doomed to failure:



management style
bad business ideas (delivery hero)
no care about people
bad players hiring bad players
standardization ( what works for zalando doesn’t work for h24)
mass production means low quality
burning money
lack of culture
pushing people to far
short seeing, quick wins over long term relationship what is understandable if your only aim is fast exit
what is wrong with investors?



So if there is only one thing to remember from this post, it’s this one: avoid anything and anyone connected to Rocket Internet. If you are an employee, don’t work for them or look for a job there. If you are an employer, don’t hire people who worked long for Rocket Internet companies (especially their ex-executives, double check skills of their other staff). If you are investor, don’t give them your money. And if you are customer, don’t use or buy their products, they don’t truly care about you anyway.


based on home24, delivery hero and mentioned hello fresh as a business idea
