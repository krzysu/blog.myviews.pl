# You don't need another software engineer

I was recently on a meet-up titled Building your Engineering Team. What I found out was that all companies are striving to get the best talent out there. I mean, it's not that I didn't know that before. But it somehow struck me that day. They are all looking for some magical trick how to hire best people. Mainly it's about optimizing process to go through as many candidates as possible, in short time, and how to figure out puzzles or other questions or assignments to validate candidate skills and fit for the job. I see the same tendency as in other areas of startup or company life: go for more, and more, and more (..).

What if I tell you that probably you don't need most of that? That you don't need to hire your hundred-first engineer to run average size online shop. That your business would have been fine with 1/3rd of your technology team, if you just did it right.

I'm a software engineer. (For all recruiters reading this, I'm NOT looking for a job ðŸ˜‰). From my position I see a huge waste on management level. I will be referring to 'you' as a manager or executive, in contrast to 'us', developers.

By waste I mean:
- lack of long term vision and strategy, including lack of product roadmap etc. - in short, you don't know what you really want to build, what leads to
- poor ideas thrown on us
- frequent change requests, or even
- running in circles
It's also common that we build products or features no one really needs or what's worse, things that will never be used or tested with real users.

So you think that you need more people, but in reality you are just *wasting our time*.

And before you start arguing, believe me, I know:
- about lean startup, iterations and validating your business ideas
- about A/B testing
- that you are paying us for that, (but often not from your own money)

I assure you that you could save a lot of money and resources if you just did your own homework before throwing stuff on developers. Or even better, just let them do the stuff. Give them goal, idea or vision and let them do the job. You are hiring the best talent anyway, yes? So just get out of their way.

And please, never give us your solutions. In many cases you 

Another big waste of management is neglecting importance of software quality.

hiring wrong people
seeing engineers as production line workers

What we can do about it?
- get your ideas, expectations
do not give solutions


I hope you know already that in software development, work done by one person in 10days cannot be done by 10 people in 1 day. Throwing more developers on your already poorly managed and planned project will only make it worse.
And stop thinking about deadlines. Stop pushing people. Time spend on quality now will benefit you in all the future projects.
