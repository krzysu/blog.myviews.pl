>  A few words about self-development.

My goal is to show you how to be happy as a software engineer. It doesn't matter if you are senior or junior. Absolute must is a constant, never-finished **self development**. There is no other way in our profession. Technologies that we are working with are changing and developing all the time. New versions of programming languages, libraries and frameworks (almost) always bring new possibilities, better performance and improving our everyday work life. Thanks to that, we can create more, better, faster and easier. As an employer always favor people who want to learn more and they admit to gaps in their knowledge but they are willing to fill them. However, avoid people who claim that they know already everything. They will cause you only troubles.

Now, attention please. This is important. Self-development of a great programmer **is not only about improving your technical skills(!)**. Of course, your technical knowledge and experience are important but let's consider following examples:
- so what, if you've implemented hundreds of features in a product that no one needs?
- so what, if your backend is optimized for performance while user interface is terrible and no one knows how to use your app?
- so what, if you are using all the latest and coolest technologies while you are loosing your health and friends to over-hours in badly managed project?
- so what, if you know by heart the whole ECMAScript specification while no one from your team understands what you are talking about?
- so what, if you configured servers to handle milion of request per second while your boss is not able to pay your next salary?

Above examples are presenting mistakes in a few areas related to programmer job:
- product development,
- user interface and user experience (UI and UX),
- project management,
- soft skills,
- business.

**So if these topics are related to our profession, would be great to have at least some basic knowledge about them**.

Why do we need all this knowledge? I assure you, it will change a lot in your life. In your everyday job, you will not only think ***what*** to do, but you will start considering ***why***. You will start asking questions, sometimes hard for your managers. You will stop accepting silly ideas forced on you. You will start seeing things that you have missed before. You will deliver solutions instead of being a "production line worker". As a result, you will do your job better and more consciously. You will feel better and more worthy. Your employer will appreciate you more and will give you more challenging and responsible tasks.

**That is how an average programmer is becoming a true software engineer. She can deliver solutions to her employer problems.**

I want to talk now about a big issue I see in our profession. **Many companies don't treat us as experienced engineers but as a labor force of XXI centaury, new production line workers**. And I must say, this is our fault. We are stuck to our computers and desks, typing thousands of lines of unnecessary code just because someone told us to do it.

Let's digress now and think about a profession of a construction engineer. Her job is to build a bridge. From the beginning of the project she knows where the bridge should be placed and what is the expected traffic it should handle. Our construction engineer prepares project based on the input data. Then the bridge is built according to the plan. I assume there might be some corrections or adjustments along the way but main project plans and goals don't change.
